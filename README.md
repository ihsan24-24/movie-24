# Project : Movie App

## Description and use of the site

In this project, A movie viewing site was created using TMDB's api and Google firebase. You can sign-in any e-mail or you can sing-up with Google. 
After the user is logged in, favorites and user control are done with redux, so when you refresh the page, the states are empty. 
I will add redux-persist next week... the project took about 5 days. I didn't progress in sync with github, I uploaded it to github after it was finished

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the project, you will be able to;

- improve coding skills within HTML & CSS & JS & ReactJS & Axios & React-Router & React-Redux & Google Firebase.

- use git commands (push, pull, commit, add etc.) and Github as Version Control System.

## Problem Statement

- We are adding a new project to our portfolios. So you and your colleagues have started to work on the project.

### Overview

I mastered HTML & CSS & JS & ReactJS features in this project.
You can see the visual representation of the website above.

## Notes

- Step 1: Create React App using `npx create-react-app project-name`

- Step 2: Push your application into your own public repo on Github

- Step 3: Add project gif to your project and README.md file.

## Resources

- 🔥 You can use [`Edemam-API`](https://edemam.com/) for your own work.

## Support
Open an Issue, I will check it a soon as possible 👀
Don't forget to start the repo ⭐
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
